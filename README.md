A simple and straightforward zoom mod. 
It allows the use of zoom with smooth animation, enabling the ability to see into the distance. 

The mod provides the ability to change the `Zoom multiplier`. This can be done by changing the value in the `my-zoom-config.json5` file in the `config` folder from `2` to `16`, as well as through `ModMenu`.

This is my first mod, my first attempt at learning Minecraft modding.
